Attempted to make my own perlin noise implementation, but eventually downloaded a module for it
Started sorting colors in the histogram by their "distance" to white
Mapped colors in the histogram to values between 0 and 255 to map histogram colors to noise
Added a fade function so that there's a smooth transition between colors
Drew a pixel octopus alpha mask
Added a function that applies the octopus mask to colored noise, and generates an octopus image
Manually add octopi to the image
Automatically randomly add octopi to image
Octopi are deleted when clicked
Timer added
Game cycles through images after all octopi in a level have been clicked
Game says "you won" when all levels are complete, and "you lost" when time runs out
