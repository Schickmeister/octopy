Octo.py is a "find the hidden object" game with a twist: the objects hide themselves. By analyzing the images, octopi blend into the background and hide themselves from the user. The object of the game is to find octopi in a limited amount of time. As the game progresses, the time limit gets shorter, until you finally run out of time. As a stretch feature, users may also have the option to upload their own images to be used in the game from their computer, search the internet for images without leaving the game, and even upload a picture taken from their webcam. Octo.py will used Pillow, a fork of PIL (the Python Imaging Library) for basic image manipulation like resizing the uploaded image to the size of the screen, and for reading in rgb data from the images for processing. Pygame will also be used for displaying images, and getting user input through mouse clicks and key presses. Stretch features might require the use of a web API for getting images online, Tkinter for a file dialog box, and Pygame again for taking pictures from the user's camera.
